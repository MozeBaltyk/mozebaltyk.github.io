When it come about IT, git is impossible to be ignore... even for an infrastructure guys!

## The bad Surprise

Few days ago, I was wondering why my commits are not counted in my Github Activity Dashboard after a good day of pushing code...

After a quick investigation, I notice that in my project directory `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` are not set.

I go in Github to checks my last commit, actually it's right my push was done with the `git config --global user.name`.

Not a big deal, but this reveal my name when I would rather appreciate to stay anonymous (just a personnal choice).


## A good Solution

I developed a while ago, a tools name [AnsiColt](https://github.com/MozeBaltyk/AnsiColt) to handle the creation of Ansible Collections and manage the diverses projects that I maintain through all my repositories which are divided between Github and GitLab repositories.

One of my hassle is that I am involved in projects stored on diverse SVC as Github or Gitlab. During cloning process, I did not immediatly set the user individually for each projects, so instead of, it was reling on the global config.

Here is the joy of coding, Continously Integration and the good opportunity to kickstart my blog on some banal stories...


## And an Opportunity...

Let's make a small reminder on some basics about git! There are plenty of article, tutorials on the Net but this article is going to be my personnal notes on the topics. 

Each project local or hosted have a hidden directory `.git` with its own `.git/config` but you also got in your home directory an `.gitconfig` which is global. 
So when in the `.git/config` of your project, it does not find the user and email, it get the global one from `~/.gitconfig` or ask you to set it up. This can become relevant when you are handling a lot of projects between different repositories publics and on premise. 

So usually, you will have to setup: 

```bash
# Setup
cd ~/my_project
git config user.name "john.smith"
git config user.email "john.smith@example.com"

# Check
git config user.name
git config user.email

git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```



## Git with a Github projects

As you probably know, there is three method to connect to a github project with git, SSH, HTTPS and gh. 

SSH will go through port 22. This make look obvious way to go but sometime in your company and specially if you work on a VPN, the port 22 will be block to outbound network.

HTTPS have one advantage, it is that you will probably always be able to clone. 

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/MozeBaltyk/mozebaltyk.github.io.git
```

Ok but Github.com decided to block password method. So you will need to initiate a connexion first with GH so you can get a token as describe below:

```bash
gh auth login 

gh auth status -t 
github.com
  âœ“ Logged in to github.com as MozeBaltyk (~/.config/gh/hosts.yml)
  âœ“ Git operations for github.com configured to use ssh protocol.
  âœ“ Token: gho_*******************************
  âœ“ Token scopes: admin:public_key, gist, read:org, repo

# And give the token everytime, you want to push... (Password is not what you think, it's expecting the Token)
git push                                                                                                                                           
Username for 'https://github.com': MozeBaltyk
Password for 'https://MozeBaltyk@github.com':

To https://github.com/mozebaltyk/mozebaltyk.github.io.git
   26a5e21b..ab53b64f  main -> main
```

This one used to work but I think not anymore (I should try it)
```bash
#Connect with token 
git config --global url."https://${username}:${access_token}@github.com".insteadOf "https://github.com"
```

But the best is to switch to SSH (if you can) which allow you to set a ssh key. So if you need to switch from HTTPS to SSH

```bash
# at project level
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:MozeBaltyk/abc.git

# in the project's .git/config, then you should have:
[remote "origin"]
        url = git@github.com:MozeBaltyk/mozebaltyk.github.io.git

# at the global level
git config --global url.ssh://git@github.com/.insteadOf https://github.com/

# or local
cd my_project
git config url.ssh://git@github.com/.insteadOf https://github.com/
```

Then configure which ssh key to use for Github in $HOME/.ssh/config (create directory/file if necessary)
```bash
# Github
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

The top is to use `gh` which is the github-cli tools for handling github projects. So it's noticable that github prefers SSH protocol over HTTPS.

```bash
# Cloning with GH will set SSH as default protocol 
 gh repo clone MozeBaltyk/MozeBaltyk

# gh clone https is also possible
gh repo clone https://github.com/MozeBaltyk/mozebaltyk.github.io.git

# this one I do not know for what it is ...
 gh repo clone  git+https://github.com/MozeBaltyk/AnsiColt.git
```
