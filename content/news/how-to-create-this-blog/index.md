When prospecting about creating my Blog; I went throught the normal questions that everybody have.    
Here were my thoughts and what I learnt...

<!--more-->

In few Questions: 
  - Where to host the Blog ?
  - Which Techno to use ?
  - Which super Theme to use ?

## Edit Articles 

```bash
 hugo new news/new-post/index.md
 hugo new news/new-post/index.fr.md
 hugo new news/new-post/index.pl.md
```

Please remind that, the created posts are generally in draft state. Youâ€™ll need to specify the `-D` parameter of the command hugo server for previewing. Similarly, you need to change the draft to false or remove draft parameter if you want to publish the article.
