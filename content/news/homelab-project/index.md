A journey to my homelab...

<!--more-->

Let expose the problem, I need a homelab, of course on budget. My wife won't allow me to spend 5000$ in hardware just for house heating. First talk with my friend: "Ah you need a good NAS and a NUC!".
Ok, so the NAS have no CPU power but the NUC have it. But how to play with cluster technologies ? "Oh, then install proxmox!", Yep. but what the purpose to do virtualisation when there is no redondancy ?
So, Let's find out, if there is not another setup possible which will be more or less at the same price than a NAS + NUC.

### First the hardware

Let's study three possible setup:

* NAS + NUC

* Raspberryd-pi

* 3 or 4 mini pc


### What would I install on it...
